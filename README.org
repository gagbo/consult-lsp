* Introduction
Helm and Ivy users have extra commands that leverage lsp-mode extra information, let's try to
mimic a few features of [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/helm-lsp][helm-lsp]] and
[[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ivy][lsp-ivy]] in consult workflow (tested only with
selectrum for the time being)

* Screenshots

They tend not to be updated as often as changes happen, sorry if there are
slight differences in UI. Those shots are more about giving an idea of what's
happening.

* Commands
- consult-lsp-diagnostics :: Select diagnostics from current workspace. Pass
  prefix argument to search all workspaces
- consult-lsp-symbols :: Select symbols from current workspace. Pass prefix
  argument to search all workspaces.
- consult-lsp-file-symbols :: Interactively select a symbol from the
  current file, in a manner similar to consult-line.

There is currently no plan to add an interface to list and/or act on
code-actions, but contributions are welcome!

* Configuration
As you can do with helm-lsp,

Use the following line to replace xref-find-apropos in lsp-mode controlled
buffers:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-key lsp-mode-map [remap xref-find-apropos] #'consult-lsp-symbols)
#+end_src
