* Introduction
Helm and Ivy users have extra commands that leverage lsp-mode extra information, let's try to
mimic a few features of [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/helm-lsp][helm-lsp]] and
[[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ivy][lsp-ivy]] in consult workflow (tested only with
selectrum for the time being)

* Screenshots

* Commands
- consult-lsp-diagnostics :: Select diagnostics from current workspace. Pass
  prefix argument to search all workspaces
- consult-lsp-symbols :: Select symbols from current workspace. Pass prefix
  argument to search all workspaces.

There is currently no plan to add an interface to list and/or act on
code-actions, but contributions are welcome!

* Configuration
As you can do with helm-lsp,

Use the following lines to replace xref-find-apropos in lsp-mode controlled
buffer.s

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-key lsp-mode-map [remap xref-find-apropos] #'consult-lsp-symbols)
#+end_src
